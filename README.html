<h2>Bootcamp Module 1 Challenge Assignment</h2>
<p style="font-weight: bold">Code Refactoring of an Example Business Website That Can Benefit from Some Enhancements</p>
<br/>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This assignment -- which was for the Module 1 Challenge of the DU Coding Bootcamp -- was done for the purpose of furthering the starting introductory/basic HTML and CSS concepts and commands that are a good foundation to the full-stack (front-end and back-end) development of webpage systems. This assignment was an logical extension of the "Prework Study Guide" tool assignment that was done for an initiation for the 1st bootcamp class; Refer to below for additional information (and links) about the "Prework Study Guide" assignment.</p>
<p>This current Module 1 Challenge assignment provided a good mechanism for examining and analyzing   and understanding the external-file Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) -- design appearance -- code of an provided starter example webpage...and also a good mechanism for viewing and learning about and processing the corresponding HTML components that are in the definition code file of the webpage. And then the learned knowledge allowed for the webpage system to be improved and expanded by organizing the code elements and adding code elements to improve and expand the functionality of the webpage system.</p>
<p>This assignment focussed on the concepts/objectives of "Accessibility" and "Responsiveness"...which is for adding efficiencies and enhancements that assist users who cannot access or see certain display/interactive features of the website; and adding efficiencies and enhancements that assist with the versatility of the display functions of a website (for different capabilities of different connecting devices (screens and printers)). The situation of users being not able to access or see display/interactive features of a website can occur during connection problems or when the user has a sight disability or hearing disability. The process of building upon and improving upon the existing code of an existing webpage is called "Refactoring"...which was another learning objective of this assignment.</p>
<p>The learning of the assignment is good information for creating webpage systems that are more-user-friendly and are more-efficient by being optimized for usage with many different display devices and print devices.</p>

<p>The objectives -- user story and acceptance criteria items -- of the assignment were as follows:</p>
<br/>
<p>[ User Story ]<br/>
<br/>
AS A marketing agency<br/>
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards<br/>
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines<br/>
<br/>
[ Acceptance Criteria ]<br/>
<br/>
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards<br/>
<br/>
WHEN I view the source code<br/>
* THEN I find semantic HTML elements<br/>
<br/>
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements<br/>
* THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning<br/>
<br/>
WHEN I view the image elements<br/>
* THEN I find accessible alt attributes<br/>
<br/>
WHEN I view the heading attributes<br/>
* THEN they fall in sequential order<br/>
<br/>
WHEN I view the title element<br/>
* THEN I find a concise, descriptive title<br/>
<br/>
The webpage is a basic one that has a title header and a menu bar that links to sections of the page; with the sections initially/ideally being displayed in 2 columns that have various staggered elements of floating pictures and icons and that have various sections of surrounding text. Some pictures of the webpage are included at below.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Grading Requirements and Criteria' in addition to satisfying the items of user story and acceptance criteria that are listed at above:<br/>
<br/>
--> Technical Acceptance Criteria: 40%<br/>
<br/>
* The webpage links all function correctly.<br/>
* The webpage CSS selectors and properties are consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure.<br/>
* The webpage CSS file is properly commented.<br/>
<br/>
--> Deployment: 32%<br/>
<br/>
* The webpage is deployed at live GitHub URL and the URL is provided.<br/>
* The webpage loads with no errors.<br/>
* The webpage GitHub URL is submitted and functional; containing all of the involved repository application code files.<br/>
<br/>
--> Application Quality: 15%<br/>
<br/>
* Application resembles (at least 90%) screenshots provided in the Challenge assignment instructions.<br/>
<br/>
--> Repository Quality: 13%<br/>
<br/>
* The webpage repository has a unique name.<br/>
* The webpage repository follows best coding practices for file structure and naming conventions.<br/>
* The webpage repository follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.<br/>
* The webpage repository contains multiple descriptive commit messages.<br/>
* The webpage repository contains a quality README file that has description, screenshot, and link about/for the deployed webpage.</p>
<br/>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<br/>
Make sure that you have a GitHub membership and account to be able to view the repository of the assignment webpage system. The published GitHub Pages view of the website should be accessible on the public internet access URL without a need to have a GitHub membership/account.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<br/>
<p>To use this sample business webpage that was refactored for purposes of organization and efficiency and also attention to accessibility features...<br/>
<br/>
1. Click the menu/section links to test about their functionality; <br/>
2. Point to the pictures and graphic icons and the tab title of the webpage (and pause for a moment at each pointing) to view HTML alt/alternate text that describes the pictures/icons to users of the webpage during situations when the pictures/icons cannot be displayed;<br/>
3. Attempt to resize the browser window to change the display size of the webpage to test about the versatility of the layout content of the webpage where the layout should change to a different view that does not interfere with readability.<br/>
<br/>
The following picture shows the appearance of the upgraded refactored webpage:<br/>

<br/>
The following picture shows the appearance of the display problems that occurred when a user attempted to re-size to smaller size the starting-code version of the webpage that was refactored:<br/>
